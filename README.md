# Advent_of_Code_2024

[Get yer puzzles here](https://adventofcode.com/)

These are my solutions in Kotlin. 

While my official job title is "Mobile Developer" and I work on an Android team, the bulk of my duties over the last year have been focused on GraphQL APIs built with TypeScript and all the build, deploy, and support work that goes along with it. So this is a great opportunity to knock the *rust* off my Kotlin skillset and learn some new things too! Maybe next year I'll try it in Rust.
